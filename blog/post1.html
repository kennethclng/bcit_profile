                <p>Recently I've been reminiscing about the old days during my undergrad in Criminology at SFU. One of the most memorable things I leared was Rational Choice Theory.</p>
                <p>Rational Choice Theory was adapted from the expected-utility principle in economics; it considered an offender's hedonistic calculus comparing potential emotional benefits versus informal and other sanctions.</p>
                <p>Rational Choice Theory made several assumptions about criminological behaviour. For example, it was assumed that offenders committed crimes based on rational decision-making.</p>
                <p>One of the implications of rational-choice-based theories was the advancement of three-strike rules. Since it was assumed that criminals made rational choices, politicians attempted to curate deterrence by imposing strict penalties for serial offenders. The success of these punishments is mixed. For example, offenders may not be completely aware of these laws, thus defeating the deterring effect. Similarly, rational choice theories also failed to consider offenders with inhibited cognitive development, such as individuals diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome disorder.</p>
